Design Patterns for Situated Visualization in Augmented Reality;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327398;English;2024-11-28;Situated visualization has become an increasingly popular research area in the visualization community, fueled by advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology and immersive analytics. Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world. We conclude by discussing future research directions that will help establish a complete understanding of the design of situated visualization, including the role of interactivity, tasks, and workflows.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327398
ggdist: Visualizations of Distributions and Uncertainty in the Grammar of Graphics;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327195;English;2024-11-09;The grammar of graphics is ubiquitous, providing the foundation for a variety of popular visualization tools and toolkits. Yet support for uncertainty visualization in the grammar graphics—beyond simple variations of error bars, uncertainty bands, and density plots—remains rudimentary. Research in uncertainty visualization has developed a rich variety of improved uncertainty visualizations, most of which are difficult to create in existing grammar of graphics implementations. ggdist, an extension to the popular ggplot2 grammar of graphics toolkit, is an attempt to rectify this situation. ggdist unifies a variety of uncertainty visualization types through the lens of distributional visualization, allowing functions of distributions to be mapped to directly to visual channels (aesthetics), making it straightforward to express a variety of (sometimes weird!) uncertainty visualization types. This distributional lens also offers a way to unify Bayesian and frequentist uncertainty visualization by formalizing the latter with the help of confidence distributions. In this paper, I offer a description of this uncertainty visualization paradigm and lessons learned from its development and adoption: ggdist has existed in some form for about six years (originally as part of the tidybayes R package for post-processing Bayesian models), and it has evolved substantially over that time, with several rewrites and API re-organizations as it changed in response to user feedback and expanded to cover increasing varieties of uncertainty visualization types. Ultimately, given the huge expressive power of the grammar of graphics and the popularity of tools built on it, I hope a catalog of my experience with ggdist will provide a catalyst for further improvements to formalizations and implementations of uncertainty visualization in grammar of graphics ecosystems.

PromptMagician: Interactive Prompt Engineering for Text-to-Image Creation;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327168;English;2024-05-28;Generative text-to-image models have gained great popularity among the public for their powerful capability to generate high-quality images based on natural language prompts. However, developing effective prompts for desired images can be challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. This research proposes PromptMagician, a visual analysis system that helps users explore the image results and refine the input prompts. The backbone of our system is a prompt recommendation model that takes user prompts as input, retrieves similar prompt-image pairs from DiffusionDB, and identifies special (important and relevant) prompt keywords. To facilitate interactive prompt refinement, PromptMagician introduces a multi-level visualization for the cross-modal embedding of the retrieved images and recommended keywords, and supports users in specifying multiple criteria for personalized exploration. Two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system, suggesting it facilitates prompt engineering and improves the creativity support of the generative text-to-image model.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327168
Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Education: A Call to Action;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327378;English;2024-11-24;This paper is a call to action for research and discussion on data visualization education. As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper—educators and researchers in data visualization—identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world: viseducationchallenges.github.io.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327378
Affective Visualization Design: Leveraging the Emotional Impact of Data;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327385;English;2024-08-29;In recent years, more and more researchers have reflected on the undervaluation of emotion in data visualization and highlighted the importance of considering human emotion in visualization design. Meanwhile, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to explore emotion-related factors. However, so far, this research area is still in its early stages and faces a set of challenges, such as the unclear definition of key concepts, the insufficient justification of why emotion is important in visualization design, and the lack of characterization of the design space of affective visualization design. To address these challenges, first, we conducted a literature review and identified three research lines that examined both emotion and data visualization. We clarified the differences between these research lines and kept 109 papers that studied or discussed how data visualization communicates and influences emotion. Then, we coded the 109 papers in terms of how they justified the legitimacy of considering emotion in visualization design (i.e., why emotion is important) and identified five argumentative perspectives. Based on these papers, we also identified 61 projects that practiced affective visualization design. We coded these design projects in three dimensions, including design fields (where), design tasks (what), and design methods (how), to explore the design space of affective visualization design.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327385
ARGUS: Visualization of AI-Assisted Task Guidance in AR;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327396;English;2024-10-06;The concept of augmented reality (AR) assistants has captured the human imagination for decades, becoming a staple of modern science fiction. To pursue this goal, it is necessary to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods that simultaneously perceive the 3D environment, reason about physical tasks, and model the performer, all in real-time. Within this framework, a wide variety of sensors are needed to generate data across different modalities, such as audio, video, depth, speech, and time-of-flight. The required sensors are typically part of the AR headset, providing performer sensing and interaction through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. AI assistants not only record the performer as they perform activities, but also require machine learning (ML) models to understand and assist the performer as they interact with the physical world. Therefore, developing such assistants is a challenging task. We propose ARGUS, a visual analytics system to support the development of intelligent AR assistants. Our system was designed as part of a multi-year-long collaboration between visualization researchers and ML and AR experts. This co-design process has led to advances in the visualization of ML in AR. Our system allows for online visualization of object, action, and step detection as well as offline analysis of previously recorded AR sessions. It visualizes not only the multimodal sensor data streams but also the output of the ML models. This allows developers to gain insights into the performer activities as well as the ML models, helping them troubleshoot, improve, and fine-tune the components of the AR assistant.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327396
Let the Chart Spark: Embedding Semantic Context into Chart with Text-to-Image Generative Model;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326913;English;2024-03-08;Pictorial visualization seamlessly integrates data and semantic context into visual representation, conveying complex information in an engaging and informative manner. Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to their predefined entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative models. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative models combined with an interactive interface for visualization design.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326913
Unraveling the Design Space of Immersive Analytics: A Systematic Review;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327368;English;2024-05-05;Immersive analytics has emerged as a promising research area, leveraging advances in immersive display technologies and techniques, such as virtual and augmented reality, to facilitate data exploration and decision-making. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 73 studies published between 2013-2022 on immersive analytics systems and visualizations, aiming to identify and categorize the primary dimensions influencing their design. We identified five key dimensions:  Academic Theory and Contribution,  Immersive Technology,  Data,  Spatial Presentation, and  Visual Presentation. Academic Theory and Contribution assess the motivations behind the works and their theoretical frameworks. Immersive Technology examines the display and input modalities, while Data dimension focuses on dataset types and generation. Spatial Presentation discusses the environment, space, embodiment, and collaboration aspects in IA, and Visual Presentation explores the visual elements, facet and position, and manipulation of views. By examining each dimension individually and cross-referencing them, this review uncovers trends and relationships that help inform the design of immersive systems visualizations. This analysis provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, offering guidance in designing future immersive analytics systems and shaping the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.

Data Player: Automatic Generation of Data Videos with Narration-Animation Interplay;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327197;English;2024-08-11;Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player's efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327197
MeTACAST: Target- and Context-Aware Spatial Selection in VR;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326517;English;2024-12-25;We propose three novel spatial data selection techniques for particle data in VR visualization environments. They are designed to be target- and context-aware and be suitable for a wide range of data features and complex scenarios. Each technique is designed to be adjusted to particular selection intents: the selection of consecutive dense regions, the selection of filament-like structures, and the selection of clusters—with all of them facilitating post-selection threshold adjustment. These techniques allow users to precisely select those regions of space for further exploration—with simple and approximate 3D pointing, brushing, or drawing input—using flexible point- or path-based input and without being limited by 3D occlusions, non-homogeneous feature density, or complex data shapes. These new techniques are evaluated in a controlled experiment and compared with the Baseline method, a region-based 3D painting selection. Our results indicate that our techniques are effective in handling a wide range of scenarios and allow users to select data based on their comprehension of crucial features. Furthermore, we analyze the attributes, requirements, and strategies of our spatial selection methods and compare them with existing state-of-the-art selection methods to handle diverse data features and situations. Based on this analysis we provide guidelines for choosing the most suitable 3D spatial selection techniques based on the interaction environment, the given data characteristics, or the need for interactive post-selection threshold adjustment.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326517
Vistrust: a Multidimensional Framework and Empirical Study of Trust in Data Visualizations;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326579;English;2024-08-21;Trust is an essential aspect of data visualization, as it plays a crucial role in the interpretation and decision-making processes of users. While research in social sciences outlines the multi-dimensional factors that can play a role in trust formation, most data visualization trust researchers employ a single-item scale to measure trust. We address this gap by proposing a comprehensive, multidimensional conceptualization and operationalization of trust in visualization. We do this by applying general theories of trust from social sciences, as well as synthesizing and extending earlier work and factors identified by studies in the visualization field. We apply a two-dimensional approach to trust in visualization, to distinguish between cognitive and affective elements, as well as between visualization and data-specific trust antecedents. We use our framework to design and run a large crowd-sourced study to quantify the role of visual complexity in establishing trust in science visualizations. Our study provides empirical evidence for several aspects of our proposed theoretical framework, most notably the impact of cognition, affective responses, and individual differences when establishing trust in visualizations.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326579
InkSight: Leveraging Sketch Interaction for Documenting Chart Findings in Computational Notebooks;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327170;English;2024-08-20;Computational notebooks have become increasingly popular for exploratory data analysis due to their ability to support data exploration and explanation within a single document. Effective documentation for explaining chart findings during the exploration process is essential as it helps recall and share data analysis. However, documenting chart findings remains a challenge due to its time-consuming and tedious nature. While existing automatic methods alleviate some of the burden on users, they often fail to cater to users' specific interests. In response to these limitations, we present InkSight, a mixed-initiative computational notebook plugin that generates finding documentation based on the user's intent. InkSight allows users to express their intent in specific data subsets through sketching atop visualizations intuitively. To facilitate this, we designed two types of sketches, i.e., open-path and closed-path sketch. Upon receiving a user's sketch, InkSight identifies the sketch type and corresponding selected data items. Subsequently, it filters data fact types based on the sketch and selected data items before employing existing automatic data fact recommendation algorithms to infer data facts. Using large language models (GPT-3.5), InkSight converts data facts into effective natural language documentation. Users can conveniently fine-tune the generated documentation within InkSight. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of InkSight in expressing user intent and facilitating chart finding documentation.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327170
InvVis: Large-Scale Data Embedding for Invertible Visualization;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326597;English;2024-05-03;We present InvVis, a new approach for invertible visualization, which is reconstructing or further modifying a visualization from an image. InvVis allows the embedding of a significant amount of data, such as chart data, chart information, source code, etc., into visualization images. The encoded image is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. We propose a new method to efficiently express chart data in the form of images, enabling large-capacity data embedding. We also outline a model based on the invertible neural network to achieve high-quality data concealing and revealing. We explore and implement a variety of application scenarios of InvVis. Additionally, we conduct a series of evaluation experiments to assess our method from multiple perspectives, including data embedding quality, data restoration accuracy, data encoding capacity, etc. The result of our experiments demonstrates the great potential of InvVis in invertible visualization.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326597
AttentionViz: A Global View of Transformer Attention;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327163;English;2024-12-01;Transformer models are revolutionizing machine learning, but their inner workings remain mysterious. In this work, we present a new visualization technique designed to help researchers understand the self-attention mechanism in transformers that allows these models to learn rich, contextual relationships between elements of a sequence. The main idea behind our method is to visualize a joint embedding of the query and key vectors used by transformer models to compute attention. Unlike previous attention visualization techniques, our approach enables the analysis of global patterns across multiple input sequences. We create an interactive visualization tool, AttentionViz (demo: http://attentionviz.com), based on these joint query-key embeddings, and use it to study attention mechanisms in both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in improving model understanding and offering new insights about query-key interactions through several application scenarios and expert feedback.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327163
Swaying the Public? Impacts of Election Forecast Visualizations on Emotion, Trust, and Intention in the 2022 U.S. Midterms;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327356;English;2024-04-16;"We conducted a longitudinal study during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, investigating the real-world impacts of uncertainty visualizations. Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts: single quantile dotplot (1-Dotplot), dual quantile dotplots (2-Dotplot), dual histogram intervals (2-Interval), and Plinko quantile dotplot (Plinko), an animated design with a physical and probabilistic analogy. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022, to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We use Bayesian multilevel modeling and post-stratification to produce demographically-representative estimates of people's emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people's intentions to participate in elections. 2-Interval shows the strongest effects across all measures; 1-Dotplot increases trust the most after elections. Both visualizations create emotional and trust gaps between different partisan identities, especially when a Republican candidate is predicted to win. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization. This intriguing interplay between visualization types, partisanship, and trust exemplifies the fundamental challenge of disentangling visualization from its context, underscoring a need for deeper investigation into the real-world impacts of visualizations.

Socrates: Data Story Generation via Adaptive Machine-Guided Elicitation of User Feedback;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327363;English;2024-06-11;Visual data stories can effectively convey insights from data, yet their creation often necessitates intricate data exploration, insight discovery, narrative organization, and customization to meet the communication objectives of the storyteller. Existing automated data storytelling techniques, however, tend to overlook the importance of user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327363
Leveraging Historical Medical Records as a Proxy via Multimodal Modeling and Visualization to Enrich Medical Diagnostic Learning;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326929;English;2024-07-22;Simulation-based Medical Education (SBME) has been developed as a cost-effective means of enhancing the diagnostic skills of novice physicians and interns, thereby mitigating the need for resource-intensive mentor-apprentice training. However, feedback provided in most SBME is often directed towards improving the operational proficiency of learners, rather than providing summative medical diagnoses that result from experience and time. Additionally, the multimodal nature of medical data during diagnosis poses significant challenges for interns and novice physicians, including the tendency to overlook or over-rely on data from certain modalities, and difficulties in comprehending potential associations between modalities. To address these challenges, we present DiagnosisAssistant, a visual analytics system that leverages historical medical records as a proxy for multimodal modeling and visualization to enhance the learning experience of interns and novice physicians. The system employs elaborately designed visualizations to explore different modality data, offer diagnostic interpretive hints based on the constructed model, and enable comparative analyses of specific patients. Our approach is validated through two case studies and expert interviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing medical training.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326929
The Urban Toolkit: A Grammar-Based Framework for Urban Visual Analytics;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326598;English;2024-02-03;While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to use new advances in data collection, management, and analysis to address their problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights. In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges. When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort. This makes the entire visual data exploration and system implementation difficult for programmers and also sets a high entry barrier for urban experts outside of computer science. With this in mind, in this paper, we present the Urban Toolkit (UTK), a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind. In order to facilitate the integration and visualization of different urban data, we also propose the concept of knots to merge thematic and physical urban layers. We evaluate our approach through use cases and a series of interviews with experts and practitioners from different domains, including urban accessibility, urban planning, architecture, and climate science. UTK is available at urbantk.org.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326598
TactualPlot: Spatializing Data as Sound Using Sensory Substitution for Touchscreen Accessibility;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326937;English;2024-03-23;Tactile graphics are one of the best ways for a blind person to perceive a chart using touch, but their fabrication is often costly, time-consuming, and does not lend itself to dynamic exploration. Refreshable haptic displays tend to be expensive and thus unavailable to most blind individuals. We propose TactualPlot, an approach to sensory substitution where touch interaction yields auditory (sonified) feedback. The technique relies on embodied cognition for spatial awareness—i.e., individuals can perceive 2D touch locations of their fingers with reference to other 2D locations such as the relative locations of other fingers or chart characteristics that are visualized on touchscreens. Combining touch and sound in this way yields a scalable data exploration method for scatterplots where the data density under the user's fingertips is sampled. The sample regions can optionally be scaled based on how quickly the user moves their hand. Our development of TactualPlot was informed by formative design sessions with a blind collaborator, whose practice while using tactile scatterplots caused us to expand the technique for multiple fingers. We present results from an evaluation comparing our TactualPlot interaction technique to tactile graphics printed on swell touch paper.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326937
Data Navigator: An Accessibility-Centered Data Navigation Toolkit;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327393;English;2024-09-19;Making data visualizations accessible for people with disabilities remains a significant challenge in current practitioner efforts. Existing visualizations often lack an underlying navigable structure, fail to engage necessary input modalities, and rely heavily on visual-only rendering practices. These limitations exclude people with disabilities, especially users of assistive technologies. To address these challenges, we present Data Navigator: a system built on a dynamic graph structure, enabling developers to construct navigable lists, trees, graphs, and flows as well as spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic relations. Data Navigator supports a wide range of input modalities: screen reader, keyboard, speech, gesture detection, and even fabricated assistive devices. We present 3 case examples with Data Navigator, demonstrating we can provide accessible navigation structures on top of raster images, integrate with existing toolkits at scale, and rapidly develop novel prototypes. Data Navigator is a step towards making accessible data visualizations easier to design and implement.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327393
Adaptively Placed Multi-Grid Scene Representation Networks for Large-Scale Data Visualization;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327194;English;2024-09-03;Scene representation networks (SRNs) have been recently proposed for compression and visualization of scientific data. However, state-of-the-art SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality. We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN) and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and transfer functions can be explored. A copy of this paper, all code, all models used in our experiments, and all supplemental materials and videos are available at https://github.com/skywolf829/APMGSRN.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327194
Dataopsy: Scalable and Fluid Visual Exploration using Aggregate Query Sculpting;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326594;English;2024-09-19;We present aggregate query sculpting (AQS), a faceted visual query technique for large-scale multidimensional data. As a “born scalable” query technique, AQS starts visualization with a single visual mark representing an aggregation of the entire dataset. The user can then progressively explore the dataset through a sequence of operations abbreviated as $\mathbb{P}^{6}$: pivot (facet an aggregate based on an attribute), partition (lay out a facet in space), peek (see inside a subset using an aggregate visual representation), pile (merge two or more subsets), project (extracting a subset into a new substrate), and prune (discard an aggregate not currently of interest). We validate AQS with Dataopsy, a prototype implementation of AQS that has been designed for fluid interaction on desktop and touch-based mobile devices. We demonstrate AQS and Dataopsy using two case studies and three application examples.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326594
From Shock to Shift: Data Visualization for Constructive Climate Journalism;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327185;English;2024-09-22;We present a multi-dimensional, multi-level, and multi-channel approach to data visualization for the purpose of constructive climate journalism. Data visualization has assumed a central role in environmental journalism and is often used in data stories to convey the dramatic consequences of climate change and other ecological crises. However, the emphasis on the catastrophic impacts of climate change tends to induce feelings of fear, anxiety, and apathy in readers. Climate mitigation, adaptation, and protection—all highly urgent in the face of the climate crisis—are at risk of being overlooked. These topics are more difficult to communicate as they are hard to convey on varying levels of locality, involve multiple interconnected sectors, and need to be mediated across various channels from the printed newspaper to social media platforms. So far, there has been little research on data visualization to enhance affective engagement with data about climate protection as part of solution-oriented reporting of climate change. With this research we characterize the unique challenges of constructive climate journalism for data visualization and share findings from a research and design study in collaboration with a national newspaper in Germany. Using the affordances and aesthetics of travel postcards, we present Klimakarten, a data journalism project on the progress of climate protection at multiple spatial scales (from national to local), across five key sectors (agriculture, buildings, energy, mobility, and waste), and for print and online use. The findings from quantitative and qualitative analysis of reader feedback confirm our overall approach and suggest implications for future work.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327185
Dead or Alive: Continuous Data Profiling for Interactive Data Science;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327367;English;2024-06-03;"Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively (“live”) and the other updates only on demand (“dead”). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support.";http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327367
Heuristics for Supporting Cooperative Dashboard Design;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327158;English;2024-06-24;"Dashboards are no longer mere static displays of metrics; through functionality such as interaction and storytelling, they have evolved to support analytic and communicative goals like monitoring and reporting. Existing dashboard design guidelines, however, are often unable to account for this expanded scope as they largely focus on best practices for visual design. In contrast, we frame dashboard design as facilitating an analytical conversation: a cooperative, interactive experience where a user may interact with, reason about, or freely query the underlying data. By drawing on established principles of conversational flow and communication, we define the concept of a cooperative dashboard as one that enables a fruitful and productive analytical conversation, and derive a set of 39 dashboard design heuristics to support effective analytical conversations. To assess the utility of this framing, we asked 52 computer science and engineering graduate students to apply our heuristics to critique and design dashboards as part of an ungraded, opt-in homework assignment. Feedback from participants demonstrates that our heuristics surface new reasons dashboards may fail, and encourage a more fluid, supportive, and responsive style of dashboard design. Our approach suggests several compelling directions for future work, including dashboard authoring tools that better anticipate conversational turn-taking, repair, and refinement and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows.";http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327158
TimeSplines: Sketch-Based Authoring of Flexible and Idiosyncratic Timelines;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326520;English;2024-11-11;"Timelines are essential for visually communicating chronological narratives and reflecting on the personal and cultural significance of historical events. Existing visualization tools tend to support conventional linear representations, but fail to capture personal idiosyncratic conceptualizations of time. In response, we built TimeSplines, a visualization authoring tool that allows people to sketch multiple free-form temporal axes and populate them with heterogeneous, time-oriented data via incremental and lazy data binding. Authors can bend, compress, and expand temporal axes to emphasize or de-emphasize intervals based on their personal importance; they can also annotate the axes with text and figurative elements to convey contextual information. The results of two user studies show how people appropriate the concepts in TimeSplines to express their own conceptualization of time, while our curated gallery of images demonstrates the expressive potential of our approach.";http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326520
Knowledge Graphs in Practice: Characterizing their Users, Challenges, and Visualization Opportunities;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326904;English;2024-04-21;This study presents insights from interviews with nineteen Knowledge Graph (KG) practitioners who work in both enterprise and academic settings on a wide variety of use cases. Through this study, we identify critical challenges experienced by KG practitioners when creating, exploring, and analyzing KGs that could be alleviated through visualization design. Our findings reveal three major personas among KG practitioners – KG Builders, Analysts, and Consumers – each of whom have their own distinct expertise and needs. We discover that KG Builders would benefit from schema enforcers, while KG Analysts need customizable query builders that provide interim query results. For KG Consumers, we identify a lack of efficacy for node-link diagrams, and the need for tailored domain-specific visualizations to promote KG adoption and comprehension. Lastly, we find that implementing KGs effectively in practice requires both technical and social solutions that are not addressed with current tools, technologies, and collaborative workflows. From the analysis of our interviews, we distill several visualization research directions to improve KG usability, including knowledge cards that balance digestibility and discoverability, timeline views to track temporal changes, interfaces that support organic discovery, and semantic explanations for AI and machine learning predictions.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326904
NL2Color: Refining Color Palettes for Charts with Natural Language;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326522;English;2024-06-02;Choice of color is critical to creating effective charts with an engaging, enjoyable, and informative reading experience. However, designing a good color palette for a chart is a challenging task for novice users who lack related design expertise. For example, they often find it difficult to articulate their abstract intentions and translate these intentions into effective editing actions to achieve a desired outcome. In this work, we present NL2Color, a tool that allows novice users to refine chart color palettes using natural language expressions of their desired outcomes. We first collected and categorized a dataset of 131 triplets, each consisting of an original color palette of a chart, an editing intent, and a new color palette designed by human experts according to the intent. Our tool employs a large language model (LLM) to substitute the colors in original palettes and produce new color palettes by selecting some of the triplets as few-shot prompts. To evaluate our tool, we conducted a comprehensive two-stage evaluation, including a crowd-sourcing study ($\mathrm{N}=71$) and a within-subjects user study ($\mathrm{N}=12$). The results indicate that the quality of the color palettes revised by NL2Color has no significantly large difference from those designed by human experts. The participants who used NL2Color obtained revised color palettes to their satisfaction in a shorter period and with less effort.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326522
Transitioning to a Commercial Dashboarding System: Socio-Technical Observations and Opportunities;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326525;English;2024-05-07;Many long-established, traditional manufacturing businesses are becoming more digital and data-driven to improve their production. These companies are embracing visual analytics in these transitions through their adoption of commercial dashboarding systems. Although a number of studies have looked at the technical challenges of adopting these systems, very few have focused on the socio-technical issues that arise. In this paper, we report on the results of an interview study with 17 participants working in a range of roles at a long-established, traditional manufacturing company as they adopted Microsoft Power BI. The results highlight a number of socio-technical challenges the employees faced, including difficulties in training, using and creating dashboards, and transitioning to a modern digital company. Based on these results, we propose a number of opportunities for both companies and visualization researchers to improve these difficult transitions, as well as opportunities for rethinking how we design dashboarding systems for real-world use.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326525
Supporting Guided Exploratory Visual Analysis on Time Series Data with Reinforcement Learning;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327200;English;2024-09-09;The exploratory visual analysis (EVA) of time series data uses visualization as the main output medium and input interface for exploring new data. However, for users who lack visual analysis expertise, interpreting and manipulating EVA can be challenging. Thus, providing guidance on EVA is necessary and two relevant questions need to be answered. First, how to recommend interesting insights to provide a first glance at data and help develop an exploration goal. Second, how to provide step-by-step EVA suggestions to help identify which parts of the data to explore. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system, Visail, which generates EVA sequences to guide the exploration of time series data. As a user uploads a time series dataset, Visail can generate step-by-step EVA suggestions, while each step is visualized as an annotated chart combined with textual descriptions. The RL-based algorithm uses exploratory data analysis knowledge to construct the state and action spaces for the agent to imitate human analysis behaviors in data exploration tasks. In this way, the agent learns the strategy of generating coherent EVA sequences through a well-designed network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted an ablation study, a user study, and two case studies. The results of our evaluation suggested that Visail can provide effective guidance on supporting EVA on time series data.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327200
CLAMS: A Cluster Ambiguity Measure for Estimating Perceptual Variability in Visual Clustering;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327201;English;2023-05-04;Visual clustering is a common perceptual task in scatterplots that supports diverse analytics tasks (e.g., cluster identification). However, even with the same scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual clustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous cluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the reliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic way to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster Ambiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality measure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that affect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference between clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that estimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts cluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise separability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS outperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human annotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing and benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS. The interactive demo of CLAMS is available at clusterambiguity.dev.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327201
VideoPro: A Visual Analytics Approach for Interactive Video Programming;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326586;English;2023-12-08;Constructing supervised machine learning models for real-world video analysis require substantial labeled data, which is costly to acquire due to scarce domain expertise and laborious manual inspection. While data programming shows promise in generating labeled data at scale with user-defined labeling functions, the high dimensional and complex temporal information in videos poses additional challenges for effectively composing and evaluating labeling functions. In this paper, we propose VideoPro, a visual analytics approach to support flexible and scalable video data programming for model steering with reduced human effort. We first extract human-understandable events from videos using computer vision techniques and treat them as atomic components of labeling functions. We further propose a two-stage template mining algorithm that characterizes the sequential patterns of these events to serve as labeling function templates for efficient data labeling. The visual interface of VideoPro facilitates multifaceted exploration, examination, and application of the labeling templates, allowing for effective programming of video data at scale. Moreover, users can monitor the impact of programming on model performance and make informed adjustments during the iterative programming process. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach with two case studies and expert interviews.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326586
VIRD: Immersive Match Video Analysis for High-Performance Badminton Coaching;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327161;English;2023-06-14;Badminton is a fast-paced sport that requires a strategic combination of spatial, temporal, and technical tactics. To gain a competitive edge at high-level competitions, badminton professionals frequently analyze match videos to gain insights and develop game strategies. However, the current process for analyzing matches is time-consuming and relies heavily on manual note-taking, due to the lack of automatic data collection and appropriate visualization tools. As a result, there is a gap in effectively analyzing matches and communicating insights among badminton coaches and players. This work proposes an end-to-end immersive match analysis pipeline designed in close collaboration with badminton professionals, including Olympic and national coaches and players. We present VIRD, a VR Bird (i.e., shuttle) immersive analysis tool, that supports interactive badminton game analysis in an immersive environment based on 3D reconstructed game views of the match video. We propose a top-down analytic workflow that allows users to seamlessly move from a high-level match overview to a detailed game view of individual rallies and shots, using situated 3D visualizations and video. We collect 3D spatial and dynamic shot data and player poses with computer vision models and visualize them in VR. Through immersive visualizations, coaches can interactively analyze situated spatial data (player positions, poses, and shot trajectories) with flexible viewpoints while navigating between shots and rallies effectively with embodied interaction. We evaluated the usefulness of VIRD with Olympic and national-level coaches and players in real matches. Results show that immersive analytics supports effective badminton match analysis with reduced context-switching costs and enhances spatial understanding with a high sense of presence.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327161
From Information to Choice: A Critical Inquiry Into Visualization Tools for Decision Making;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326593;English;2023-08-22;"In the face of complex decisions, people often engage in a three-stage process that spans from (1) exploring and analyzing pertinent information (intelligence); (2) generating and exploring alternative options (design); and ultimately culminating in (3) selecting the optimal decision by evaluating discerning criteria (choice). We can fairly assume that all good visualizations aid in the “intelligence” stage by enabling data exploration and analysis. Yet, to what degree and how do visualization systems currently support the other decision making stages, namely “design” and “choice”? To further explore this question, we conducted a comprehensive review of decision-focused visualization tools by examining publications in major visualization journals and conferences, including VIS, EuroVis, and CHI, spanning all available years. We employed a deductive coding method and in-depth analysis to assess whether and how visualization tools support design and choice. Specifically, we examined each visualization tool by (i) its degree of visibility for displaying decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences, and (ii) its degree of flexibility for offering means to manipulate the decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences with interactions such as adding, modifying, changing mapping, and filtering. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges that decision-focused visualization tools face in realizing their full potential to support all stages of the decision making process. It reveals a surprising scarcity of tools that support all stages, and while most tools excel in offering visibility for decision criteria and alternatives, the degree of flexibility to manipulate these elements is often limited, and the lack of tools that accommodate decision preferences and their elicitation is notable. Based on our findings, to better support the choice stage, future research could explore enhancing flexibility levels and variety, exploring novel visualization paradigms, increasing algorithmic support, and ensuring that this automation is user-controlled via the enhanced flexibility I evels. Our curated list of the 88 surveyed visualization tools is available in the OSF link (https://osf.io/nrasz/?view_only=b92a90a34ae241449b5f2cd33383bfcb).";http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326593
InnovationInsights: A Visual Analytics Approach for Understanding the Dual Frontiers of Science and Technology;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327387;English;2023-11-30;"Science has long been viewed as a key driver of economic growth and rising standards of living. Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation. Through both the case studies and the engagement project, we find that our system not only meets our original goals of design, allowing users to better identify the sources of technical inventions and to understand the broad impact of scientific research; it also goes beyond these purposes to enable an array of new applications for researchers and research institutions, ranging from identifying untapped innovation potential within an institution to forging new collaboration opportunities between science and industry.";http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327387
Class-Constrained t-SNE: Combining Data Features and Class Probabilities;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326600;English;2023-09-04;Data features and class probabilities are two main perspectives when, e.g., evaluating model results and identifying problematic items. Class probabilities represent the likelihood that each instance belongs to a particular class, which can be produced by probabilistic classifiers or even human labeling with uncertainty. Since both perspectives are multi-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used to extract informative characteristics from them. However, existing methods either focus solely on the data feature perspective or rely on class probability estimates to guide the DR process. In contrast to previous work where separate views are linked to conduct the analysis, we propose a novel approach, class-constrained t-SNE, that combines data features and class probabilities in the same DR result. Specifically, we combine them by balancing two corresponding components in a cost function to optimize the positions of data points and iconic representation of classes – class landmarks. Furthermore, an interactive user-adjustable parameter balances these two components so that users can focus on the weighted perspectives of interest and also empowers a smooth visual transition between varying perspectives to preserve the mental map. We illustrate its application potential in model evaluation and visual-interactive labeling. A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the DR results.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326600
HealthPrism: A Visual Analytics System for Exploring Children's Physical and Mental Health Profiles with Multimodal Data;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326943;English;2023-05-17;The correlation between children's personal and family characteristics (e.g., demographics and socioeconomic status) and their physical and mental health status has been extensively studied across various research domains, such as public health, medicine, and data science. Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children's health and aid in the development of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains (e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children's health status from multi-level perspectives. Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature importance comparison. A set of visualization components is designed for experts to explore and understand multimodal data freely. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of HealthPrism through quantitative evaluation of the model performance, case studies, and expert interviews in associated domains.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326943
Classes are Not Clusters: Improving Label-Based Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327187;English;2022-07-06;"A common way to evaluate the reliability of dimensionality reduction (DR) embeddings is to quantify how well labeled classes form compact, mutually separated clusters in the embeddings. This approach is based on the assumption that the classes stay as clear clusters in the original high-dimensional space. However, in reality, this assumption can be violated; a single class can be fragmented into multiple separated clusters, and multiple classes can be merged into a single cluster. We thus cannot always assure the credibility of the evaluation using class labels. In this paper, we introduce two novel quality measures—Label-Trustworthiness and Label-Continuity (Label-T&C)—advancing the process of DR evaluation based on class labels. Instead of assuming that classes are well-clustered in the original space, Label-T&C work by (1) estimating the extent to which classes form clusters in the original and embedded spaces and (2) evaluating the difference between the two. A quantitative evaluation showed that Label-T&C outperform widely used DR evaluation measures (e.g., Trustworthiness and Continuity, Kullback-Leibler divergence) in terms of the accuracy in assessing how well DR embeddings preserve the cluster structure, and are also scalable. Moreover, we present case studies demonstrating that Label-T&C can be successfully used for revealing the intrinsic characteristics of DR techniques and their hyperparameters.";http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327187
Differentiable Design Galleries: A Differentiable Approach to Explore the Design Space of Transfer Functions;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3327371;English;2023-08-18;The transfer function is crucial for direct volume rendering (DVR) to create an informative visual representation of volumetric data. However, manually adjusting the transfer function to achieve the desired DVR result can be time-consuming and unintuitive. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Design Galleries, an image-based transfer function design approach to help users explore the design space of transfer functions by taking advantage of the recent advances in deep learning and differentiable rendering. Specifically, we leverage neural rendering to learn a latent design space, which is a continuous manifold representing various types of implicit transfer functions. We further provide a set of interactive tools to support intuitive query, navigation, and modification to obtain the target design, which is represented as a neural-rendered design exemplar. The explicit transfer function can be reconstructed from the target design with a differentiable direct volume renderer. Experimental results on real volumetric data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3327371
Cluster-Aware Grid Layout;10.1109/tvcg.2023.3326934;English;2022-10-05;Grid visualizations are widely used in many applications to visually explain a set of data and their proximity relationships. However, existing layout methods face difficulties when dealing with the inherent cluster structures within the data. To address this issue, we propose a cluster-aware grid layout method that aims to better preserve cluster structures by simultaneously considering proximity, compactness, and convexity in the optimization process. Our method utilizes a hybrid optimization strategy that consists of two phases. The global phase aims to balance proximity and compactness within each cluster, while the local phase ensures the convexity of cluster shapes. We evaluate the proposed grid layout method through a series of quantitative experiments and two use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving cluster structures and facilitating analysis tasks.;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326934
